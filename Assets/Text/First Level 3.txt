One last thing, at the end of each level, there will be an invisible wall that will only let you pass if you defeat all the enemies in the level. <Press Enter>
So donâ€™t go thinking that you can just skip fighting the enemies and finish the level. You actually get some points on defeating enemies too. <Press Enter>
Once you go past me you will find a blue gate, this will take you the next level. When near it press the W key. What are you waiting for? Go! <Press Enter>
Eh? What's that? Why the mask and all these clothes. Well it's so that I look more human. I believe the mask suits my personality. Now stop talking and go! <Press Enter>
