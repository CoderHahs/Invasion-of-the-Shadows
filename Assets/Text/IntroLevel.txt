Hello human, my name is Majoris Tirenzal, or Tiren for short. Welcome to the … well, hell at the moment, but once you're done saving the planet, it'll be heaven. So let me tell you when it all started..... <Press Enter>
The year was 2070, and the world we once knew was completely different. In the year 2055, aliens had finally been found on a planet not too far away. This planet was called Kepler 22b. Scientists had known about the planet for decades, but only in 2030 was a satellite sent to the planet. It reached the planet by 2054, and everybody on Earth celebrated this fact. After a day of orbiting, the scientists had lost all communications to the satellite. They could recover only one picture from the satellite just before they lost their communications. In the picture, scientists could clearly see two unidentified spaceships. <Press Enter>
After getting acknowledgements from governments all over the world, NASA sent a radio message directed towards the planet, hoping for a response from the extraterrestrials. About a week passed, the scientists still did not receive any response from the aliens, and human hopes had begun to fade. About a month later, they received a message, which was then decoded by cryptographers. The message read: WE ARE COMING <Press Enter>
This made headlines around the world. Everyone was excited, although some people were worried if this meant that the aliens might come to end humanity. After about two weeks NASA satellites noticed that an unidentified spaceship had entered the solar system. When scientists first got readings on the spaceship, they were mind-blown. The ship was 1/4 the size of India. As the spaceship came near Earth it started to orbit around it for hours and hours, as if studying the planet. After 16 hours, the ship finally entered the atmosphere, and it landed in the Sahara desert. Nothing happened for some time, and then the spaceship opened. <Press Enter>
From it came several (about 10) creatures, all of them surprising looked very much like humans, although you could not see many features. It was like looking at a shadow, except for the fact that it was solid. One could only see their facial features, such as the eyes and mouth. Each went in different directions. Each one was spotted in different countries. Russia, the United States, England, UAE, Australia, China, Canada, Brazil, South Africa and Germany. When the aliens reached their desired locations, each of them radiated a powerful wave of energy. <Press Enter>
This caused every electronic device to shut down and restart, showing a message that read: Prepare for World Annihilation - The Itzals or the Shadows as the humans call them. The destruction had begun, the Shadows went from one building to the other and destroyed everything in their paths, utterly and chaotically. <Press Enter>
15 years later, 90% of the human population had been destroyed. The military had tried to defend the world but could not do anything. Since that time the Shadows controlled the world. But one Shadow, a soldier in the alien army was soft-hearted and could not kill. His name was Majoris Tirenzal. He has since then been helping the remaining humans.  He gave the humans valuable information. The humans had asked him why the Itzals had attacked them. Tirenzal replied saying that an ability of theirs is to see the future. <Press Enter> 
The Itzal king had seen that a young Earthling would destroy him. He told them that his ancestors, the peace-keeping Itzals had come frequently to planet Earth, to hide small parchments of the Secret Scroll. This scroll had vital information about how to destroy the Itzals. <Press Enter>
Majoris Tirenzal told them that the only way to get these scrolls back was to go back in time and get the parchments from different time periods. He also told them, only the young earthling who defeated the Itzal king can get to the parchments. Luckily, Tirenzal knew how the earthling looked like because the king had asked an artist to draw the earthling. The remaining humans scanned the picture and tried to find a match of the earthling. Luckily, they did. You are the CHOSEN ONE. You must now save Earth. Do you accept? <Press W>
