This is the castle where the Shadow King lives, I recognize this chamber, although it has changed a bit. If I remember correctly that wall wasn’t there before….<Press Enter>
Why are you looking at me like that? Oh…the scroll? Right, so basically what the scroll said was: egwegw fkbeibei afbwfbw erjnrgbw. Or in English, it said, he who wields the Chaos Sword can conquer the Itzel King. <Press Enter>
Therefore, we mush find the Chaos Sword, which I believe is in the depths of this chamber itself. <Press Enter>
Wait a minute, these are the ancient warriors you fought. It seems the King has cloned them. Guess you have to fight them again. <Press Enter>
See you at the end of the chamber!<Press Enter>
